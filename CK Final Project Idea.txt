The name of my program will be the ZyBooks Chapter 5-8 Trivia Game.
The program will consist of a main menu that will lead a user to either start the game or quit. 
If they choose to start the game, it will lead them through a series of 10 multiple choice and true/false questions.
They will choose an answer and the program will store it into a list.
Once they complete all 10 questions, it will retrieve their score and let them know what it is. 
The user will then be able to start again from the beginning to get a better score or quit. 
I plan to use eclipse to program this project.
